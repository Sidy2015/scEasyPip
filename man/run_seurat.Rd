\arguments{
\item{data.dir}{Directory containing the matrix.mtx, genes.tsv (or features.tsv), and barcodes.tsv
files provided by 10X. A vector or named vector can be given in order to load
several data directories. If a named vector is given, the cell barcode names
will be prefixed with the name.}

\item{object}{A seurat object}

\item{output.dir}{Path to the output directory - where plots and markers file will be saved}

\item{vars.to.regress}{Variables to regress out in a second non-regularized linear
regression. For example, percent.mito. Default is NULL}

\item{dims}{Which dimensions to use as input features, used only if
\code{features} is NULL}

\item{resolution}{Value of the resolution parameter, use a value above
(below) 1.0 if you want to obtain a larger (smaller) number of communities.}

\item{only.pos}{Only return positive markers (FALSE by default)}

\item{min.pct}{only test genes that are detected in a minimum fraction of
min.pct cells in either of the two populations. Meant to speed up the function
by not testing genes that are very infrequently expressed. Default is 0.1}

\item{logfc.threshold}{Limit testing to genes which show, on average, at least
X-fold difference (log-scale) between the two groups of cells. Default is 0.25
Increasing logfc.threshold speeds up the function, but can miss weaker signals.}

\item{test.use}{Denotes which test to use. Available options are:
\itemize{
 \item{"wilcox"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
 groups of cells using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (default)
 \item{"bimod"} : Likelihood-ratio test for single cell gene expression,
 (McDavid et al., Bioinformatics, 2013)
 \item{"roc"} : Identifies 'markers' of gene expression using ROC analysis.
 For each gene, evaluates (using AUC) a classifier built on that gene alone,
 to classify between two groups of cells. An AUC value of 1 means that
 expression values for this gene alone can perfectly classify the two
 groupings (i.e. Each of the cells in cells.1 exhibit a higher level than
 each of the cells in cells.2). An AUC value of 0 also means there is perfect
 classification, but in the other direction. A value of 0.5 implies that
 the gene has no predictive power to classify the two groups. Returns a
 'predictive power' (abs(AUC-0.5) * 2) ranked matrix of putative differentially
 expressed genes.
 \item{"t"} : Identify differentially expressed genes between two groups of
 cells using the Student's t-test.
 \item{"negbinom"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
  groups of cells using a negative binomial generalized linear model.
  Use only for UMI-based datasets
 \item{"poisson"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two
  groups of cells using a poisson generalized linear model.
  Use only for UMI-based datasets
 \item{"LR"} : Uses a logistic regression framework to determine differentially
 expressed genes. Constructs a logistic regression model predicting group
 membership based on each feature individually and compares this to a null
 model with a likelihood ratio test.
 \item{"MAST"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two groups
 of cells using a hurdle model tailored to scRNA-seq data. Utilizes the MAST
 package to run the DE testing.
 \item{"DESeq2"} : Identifies differentially expressed genes between two groups
 of cells based on a model using DESeq2 which uses a negative binomial
 distribution (Love et al, Genome Biology, 2014).This test does not support
 pre-filtering of genes based on average difference (or percent detection rate)
 between cell groups. However, genes may be pre-filtered based on their
 minimum detection rate (min.pct) across both cell groups. To use this method,
 please install DESeq2, using the instructions at
 https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html
